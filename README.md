# week-1-challenge
The challenge this week was to refactor the code for Horiseon's home webpage for both code cleanliness and site accessibility.
This was accomplished but adding alt texts for images (and a title attribute for the hero image), utilizing semantic html elements where applicable, ensuring the code was structured logically, and giving the page a title.
